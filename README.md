<h4>⭐Some interesting features</h4>

<b>📕Works Section</b></br>
In this section, you'll find list of poems fetched from an open API. You can explore a variety of works. Additionally, there's a search input feature that allows you to easily search for specific works by titles. Simply enter a keyword or title in the search input, and the component will dynamically filter and display the relevant works.</br>

<b>💬Contact Form</b></br>
In this section, I've implemented template-driven forms. When a user fills out the form and submits it, the data is sent to Firestore, ensuring that I receive that message promptly.</br>
